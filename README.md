- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DomMacaluso
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating, networking, and learning skills that are in high demand for industrial mathematicians.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at Drexel University, where my thesis is on numerically estimating the stability of a traveling front solution in the neural field model.  I am also currently working as an intern for D-Prime, where I am investigating a correlation between heart-rate variability metrics during sleep and daytime stress using various biomarkers and data.
